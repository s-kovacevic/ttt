## Tic Tac Toe

#### CLI
In order to run CLI mode game just run:
```bash
python3 cli_game.py
```

#### Web app
It is still under construction but if you want to se if it runs:

1. *Optionally create python virtual environment*
2. Install requirements `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app `python3 app.py` (`--debug` is optional if you want to run in
debug mode)

I am using TinyDB to make running this app as easy as possible.
